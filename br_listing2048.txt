=============
Paradise found! This custom-built brand new home sits proudly on a 6.8-acre
high wooded site overlooking a 300-acre nature conservancy. The setting is
exceptional, and the home is every bit as exciting! A bright, open layout is 
enhanced by vaulted ceilings, hardwood and tumbled, ceramic flooring, custom 
maple cabinetry, upgraded fixtures, numerous windows, and incredible views.

There is much more. The property includes a 40x54 storage building - perfect
for a large boat and machinery. An exposed walkout on lower level leads down to
a beautiful wooded area.

An extra bathroom, bedroom, and family room can be added to the unfinished 
basement for more living space.
